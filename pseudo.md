# Pseudocode for Error Correction Script

## 1. Import necessary libraries

- Import Biopython for parsing
- Import additional modules (e.g., itertools for combinations)
- Import matplotlib or seaborn for visualization

## 2. Define input parameters

- Input file path (FASTA/FASTQ)
- K-mer length (k)
- Threshold for frequency filtering (from user)

## 3. Parse input file

- Use Biopython to read the sequences
- Store the sequences in a list (or another suitable data structure)

## 4. Count k-mers

- Initialize an empty dictionary for k-mer counts
- Loop through each sequence:
  - For each sequence, extract all k-mers of length k using a sliding window (overlapping k-mers)
  - Update k-mer count dictionary:
    - If k-mer exists in dictionary, increment its count
    - If not, add to dictionary with count = 1

## 5. Visualize k-mer frequencies before error correction

- Use matplotlib or seaborn to create a histogram of k-mer frequencies
- Plot the k-mer counts to visualize the distribution before error correction

## 6. Detect errors based on k-mer frequency

- Initialize a list to store erroneous k-mers
- Loop through k-mer dictionary:
  - If k-mer count is below the threshold, mark it as erroneous
  - Store erroneous k-mers for correction

## 7. Error Correction

### 7.1 Nucleotide Substitution

- For each sequence:
  - Extract overlapping k-mers using a sliding window
  - Identify k-mers that are marked as erroneous
  - For each erroneous k-mer:
    - Generate all possible single-nucleotide substitutions (A, T, G, C)
    - Check frequency of each substitution in the k-mer dictionary
    - Replace the erroneous k-mer with the substitution that has the highest frequency

### 7.2 Redundancy Check

- Use overlapping k-mers to confirm the correction by majority consensus if multiple k-mers cover the same position

## 8. Visualize k-mer frequencies after error correction

- Use matplotlib or seaborn to create a histogram of k-mer frequencies
- Plot the k-mer counts to visualize the distribution after error correction

## 9. Generate corrected sequences

- Create a new list to store corrected sequences
- Apply corrections to sequences

## 10. Write output

- Write corrected sequences to output file in the same format as input
- If FASTQ, maintain the quality scores as best as possible (e.g., by keeping or slightly modifying the quality score for corrected bases)

## 11. End
